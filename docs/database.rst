Other compilation notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These notes on the üóú compiled collection are written by :ref:`cli-record_compiler` and prefixed by one of:

-  ``OCID {ocid} has ## linked releases among ## dated releases and ## releases.``
-  ``OCID {ocid} has ## releases, all undated.``
-  ``OCID {ocid} has 0 releases.``

In other words, the record contains either some linked releases, only undated releases or no releases.

In these cases, it's possible that the data source's merge routine isn't correct: that is, the compiled release doesn't represent individual releases.
