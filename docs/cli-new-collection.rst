Command line tool - new-collection option
===========================================

This command creates a new collection in the system.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    python ocdskingfisher-process-cli new-collection my-own-source-id  "2019-01-20 10:00:12"
    python ocdskingfisher-process-cli new-collection my-own-source-id  "2019-01-20 10:00:12" --sample


You may not need to run this; collections will be created at certain points automatically for you.
