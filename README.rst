Kingfisher Process stores and pre-processes OCDS data. An accompanying tool, `Kingfisher Collect <https://kingfisher-collect.readthedocs.io/>`__, downloads OCDS data and optionally sends it to Kingfisher Process.

.. tip::

   Use the `OCP Data Registry <https://data.open-contracting.org>`__ to `download OCDS data <https://data.open-contracting.org>`__, worldwide. (The registry uses Kingfisher Process to prepare datasets on a regular schedule.)

(If you are viewing this on GitHub, open the `full documentation <https://kingfisher-process.readthedocs.io/>`__ for additional details.)
